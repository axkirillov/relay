const usage = `relay <file.md>

Show a markdown document to the human and wait — for as long as it takes — for
their reply. They can edit anywhere in it; their edits are highlighted live
against what you sent.

On accept, the unified diff of their edits is printed to stdout and relay exits
0. If they close the window without replying, relay exits 1 and prints nothing.

There is one relay window. Documents go through it one at a time, in the order
their relays started, so this one appears once those ahead of it are done —
and closing that window dismisses everything still waiting, this included.

Waiting for a human outlasts most command timeouts, and a queued relay waits
longer still. If the harness running this puts a clock on a command, start relay
in the background and read its output when it exits — a timeout that fires while
the window is open costs the human's reply.

  RELAY_NO_OPEN=1   serve the document but do not open a window
  RELAY_DEBUG=1     let the window's own output through to stderr
